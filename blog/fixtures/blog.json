[{"pk": 13, "model": "blog.post", "fields": {"body": "Good fuel is as essential to a nice long run as quality shoes. And, just as there are seemingly endless choices for running shoes, there's also choice after choice for on-the-go fueling. Bars, gels, chews, beans, sports drinks \u2014 the list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nBut have you ever taken a good look at what that expensive, prepackaged fuel has for ingredients? If you flip the package over and start perusing the ingredient list, there's a good chance that you'll see some ingredients that sound like they belong inside your the soles of your shoes rather than in your stomach. For example, here's the actual ingredient list from PowerBar Performance Energy's Apple Cinnamon bar:\r\n\r\nC2 MAX CARBOHYDRATE BLEND (ORGANIC EVAPORATED CANE JUICE SYRUP, MALTODEXTRIN, FRUCTOSE, DEXTROSE), OAT BRAN, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, RICE CRISPS (MILLED RICE, RICE BRAN, ROSEMARY EXTRACT), BROWN RICE FLOUR, APPLE POWDER, CANOLA OIL, AND 2% OR LESS OF: NATURAL FLAVOR, VEGETABLE GLYCERIN, SALT, CINNAMON, NONFAT MILK, ALMOND BUTTER, PEANUT FLOUR. *MINERALS*: CALCIUM PHOSPHATE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, FERROUS FUMARATE (IRON). *VITAMINS*: ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C), VITAMIN B6 HYDROCHLORIDE, RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), THIAMINE MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1).\r\n\r\nI'm sure you're saying to yourself, \"Mmmmmmm, I love soy protein isolate and vegetable glycerin!\"\r\n\r\nOr, maybe not. \r\n\r\nSame goes for most of the sports gels out there on the market. Just check out the ingredients for Hammer Gel's Apple Cinnamon flavor:\r\n\r\n*Ingredients*: Maltodextrin, Filtered Water, Apple Juice Concentrate, Energy Smart\u00ae (Fruit Juice, Natural Grain Dextrins), Ground Cinnamon, Malic Acid, Vanilla Extract, Potassium Sorbate (as a preservative), Salt, Amino Acids (L-Leucine, L-Alanine, L-Valine, L-Isoleucine), Potassium Chloride.\r\n\r\nAgain, don't potassium chloride and malic acid just sound too tasty to believe? If you're like me, well then, probably not. And it's not that a PowerBar or Hammer Gel every now and then isn't a good idea. They're products that are scientifically tested to work for athletes. But that's just it, they're products \u2014 not foods.\r\n\r\nSo why not take a chance and make your own running fuel from real, live food? It's not difficult, and it's actually both tastier and cheaper than buying prepackaged junk.\r\n\r\nOn the Web you can find all sorts of energy bar and gel recipes, but here are the two I come back to over and over again. The first is a recipe for energy bars that is sweet and satisfying thanks to a combination of dried fruit and fat from coconut and nut butter. It's a very versatile recipe that can be made with whatever you happen to have in the pantry and its shape can vary depending on your preference. I find rolling the dough into balls instead of cutting it into bars works best for me, but do whatever works for you. Also, you may have a hard time confining these to your workouts, as the balls taste great on their own as a snack or even dessert. My son loves them and thinks they're the best afternoon snack ever invented.\r\n\r\nThe second recipe is one I got from \"Coleen 'Lil' Big Hawk' Voeks\":http://runningonstrawberryhill.blogspot.com/. It's a recipe for a gel that is perfect for sustained energy on a long run. I confess, I've only made it once because it makes so much! I have a little 5-ounce Gu bottle that works really well for carrying it on a run.\r\n\r\n!http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4917777108_e600c228ee_z.jpg!\r\n\r\n*Energy Bar Balls* (adapted from \"The Natural Health Circus\":http://naturalhealthcircus.blogspot.com/2005/09/healthy-energy-bar-recipe.htm)\r\n1 cup dried apricots\r\n1 cup dried figs (I use calimyrna, but you can use a different type)\r\n1 cup dates (medjool are best)\r\n1/2 cup raisins, dried cranberries or dried cherries\r\n1 cup unsweetened coconut\r\n1/2 cup almond, cashew or peanut butter\r\n1/2 cup honey or agave nectar\r\n\r\n!http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4917778680_b947d9ed2f_z.jpg!\r\n\r\nPut apricots, figs, dates and raisins in the food processor and process until sticky (a good indicator that it's done is if it forms into one big ball). Put the dried fruit mixture into a bowl, breaking it apart a bit. With a wooden spoon, mix in coconut. Next, add in nut butter and honey and stir until well-combined.\r\n\r\n!http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4917777548_5240cb6eb8_z.jpg!\r\n\r\nI like to roll them into 1-inch balls and put them in a pan, but if you want a true \"energy bar\" you can also press the mixture into a shallow glass dish. Once you've used the mixture, place the balls or bars into the fridge to firm up. The balls can be stored in an airtight container for further use. To store the bars, cut them once they are firm and then store in an airtight container with wax paper between the layers if you decide to stack the bars.\r\n\r\n!http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4917778070_8b5cacf3dd_z.jpg!\r\n\r\n*Coleen's Goo Recipe*\r\n3 ounces brown rice syrup\r\n1 1/2 ounces honey\r\n1/2 ounces blackstrap molasses\r\n1/4 teaspoon sea salt\r\n1 teaspoon warm water\r\nMix together and consume!

Everyone has one or wants one. What's good what's bad? Should I even have one? \r\n\r\nAnyway, When it comes to light, you wanna find something that has the highest lumen count, using the lightest batteries that'll last for as long as you'll need to be on the trail. Each and every one of those attributes fight against each other.\r\n\r\nSo what does that all mean? Well the higher the lumen count, the brighter your light will be. If the count is really high, then it either needs lots of batteries, or goes through batteries, like me through french fries and beer!\r\n\r\nIf your light requires lots of batteries or big batteries it probably is to unwieldy to use as a trail running light. On the other hand if it goes through it's batteries in a couple hours that's not good either cause you're spending more time changing your batteries than you are actually running.\r\n\r\nSo what kinda attributes are you looking for then in a headlamp? Well I'd say anything under 50 lumens is not enough. And if you're going for the 70+ lumen count you should be looking at lights that use Lithium batteries. Laurie \"Pixie Hawk\" uses the \"Saint Minimus from SureFire\":http://www.rei.com/product/796823\r\n\r\nThough something else to consider is if you can get a steady hand while you run you can use a handheld light. Like me! you can get away with using a light that uses considerably less lumens, I used a \"Princeton Tec\":http://www.brightguy.com/products/Princeton_Tec_Impact_2_LED_Flashlight.php for the Leadville 100 last year. It's not the brightest light in the world, but they way it focuses it's light is pretty handy. Also when you use a handheld light it shines the light from a lower angle, meaning you get a better idea of the contours of the ground and thus your depth perception isn't all wonky.\r\n\r\nI do have a handheld (it was a gift from my mom after I finished LT100) that produces much more light, and it's a beauty to have on the trail at night. I feel like I'm holding a bit of the sun in my hand, but I don't know what it's called. It's a no name light, with the LT100 logo on it and it goes through batteries like mad. My Princeton Tec lasts forever! I think I replace the batteries in that thing like once a month or so.\r\n\r\nSo there ya go, I hope that gives you some ideas of what to look for in lights.\r\n\r\nAlso when looking for headlamps, you want something that's not gonna give a lot of bounce on your head. I highly recommend trying some on, to get an idea of how they feel. \r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind, when you run at night when it's cold, your breath will be illuminated by your headlamp and block your vision of the trail. The biggest reason I switched to a handheld. There are plenty of people who run with both as well, which is a good idea too, cause hen you can get away with cheaper headlamp (less lumens) and cheaper handheld, then you get the benefit of having light where your face is pointed, as well as having light on the trail at a lower angle giving you better depth perception.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope that gives you some ideas on what to look for. \r\n\r\nNote: Gary \"Story Hawk\" uses this \"headlamp\":http://www.rei.com/product/768981 and if I were to buy a headlamp I would probably buy that one, or the one Laurie uses. Laurie's requires special batteries, which kinda sucks, but it makes for a pretty awesome headlamp, with great power, great battery life, and light weight. You just gotta make sure you buy the batteries in bulk, and have some on you at all times, cause it's almost guaranteed any race you do, NO ONE will have spare batteries for you.", "status": 2, "allow_comments": true, "repost_date": null, "author": 1, "tease": "", "modified": "2010-08-03 10:59:04", "publish": "2010-08-03 10:58:42", "created": "2010-08-03 10:59:04", "title": "Headlamps", "repost_url": "", "slug": "headlamps", "tags": "headlamps, night running"}}, {"pk": 11, "model": "blog.post", "fields": {"body": "I want to thank each and every one of you for participating, volunteering, and just plain being at the inaugural Hawk 50 this last weekend.\r\n\r\nAll of you who participated in the event, if you have a spare moment could you please fill out this \"survey\":http://coronainsights.com/survey/surveylogin.asp?k=127387677276\r\n\r\nAgain thanks to all the participates, volunteers and spectators of the Inaugural Hawk 50!

I hope you don't take this as a bikers vs. runner issue either.  Not trying to do that at all.  I trail run in the fall and winter to mix it up.  I raised the questions post race as a sustainable trails issue.  I just happen to be the EarthRiders president right now so I'm representing the biker questions about the race.  There was some disappointment and surprise by the conditions by some riders that went to Clinton to ride post race and I just wanted to get the full story from all sides. \r\n\r\nWe have such a great system of sustainable single track in the KC Metro area.  That is very important to me.  The thing we all need to avoid, in my opinion is, is different stances on correct conditions for usage of our trail systems so that people aren't confused about when it is and is not OK to use the single track.  I would hate to have a metro area trail system volunteer group saying it's fine to do whatever and then people that use that system the most go to a different trail in poor conditions and wonder why people are upset about them using it. Consistency is key.  \r\n\r\nI agree that rogue users not connected with any of the groups in the area cause lots of issues when conditions are poor.  I don't know that there is a golden solution for education.  It's all just grass roots getting to know people and spreading the word.  Gates and cables stop the uneducated, but they don't stop those that are going to go no matter what or just don't care.\r\n\r\nI also think that racing of any pursuit puts race directors in positions that force them to make go no go decisions on trail conditions that they might not make if they were just going for a ride or run.  The money on the line, participants, course prep, volunteers all put a lot of stress on race decisions.  The amount of traffic from a race isn't like normal daily traffic.  Traffic is multiplied and can make border line trail conditions quite corrosive to the system.  That being said, racing is a part of the trail equation and needs to happen to draw in the people that are motivated by racing.  I race myself so I'm not anti-racing.  I am in favor of sustainable racing.  \r\n\r\nI have probably rambled on long enough to bore everyone.  Thanks for the professional interactions. Here is to all of us providing and managing sustainable trails and voicing a consistent message to the trail users.  \r\n\r\nBen :-)\r\n", "status": 2, "allow_comments": true, "repost_date": null, "author": 65, "tease": "", "modified": "2010-05-26 09:47:24", "publish": "2010-05-26 09:44:26", "created": "2010-05-26 09:45:00", "title": "Re: Hawk 50 - post race trail conditions", "repost_url": "", "slug": "re-hawk-50-post-race-trail-conditions", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "blog.post", "fields": {"body": "Hi Ben,\r\n\r\nMike Goodwin and I closely monitored the trail conditions up to the afternoon before the race. While they were quite muddy in some places, we \u2013 well, Mike \u2013 determined the trails were in condition to withstand the 59 starters who went out.\r\n\r\nWe had to put in a new trail section Friday on the blue-blazed trail just down the hill from the corps of engineers trailhead. The Lake was on the verge of taking the old tail down. Since then, the Lake HAS taken down the old trail, and is now on the verge of eating the new one we just put in. I\u2019ve flagged the heck out of it. Mike and I are planning to go put a new section in much further inboard.\r\n\r\nMud Creek on the blue trail was up about 4.5 feet Saturday.

So I see them day-to-day. Other than being muddy in the usual spots that are always muddy this time of year \u2013 mostly the \u201cmuddy mile\u201d \u2013 they are not in bad shape. Cactus Ridge and the skills area are certainly runnable without chewing up trail \u2013 not sure if that equates to rideable.\r\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re talking about, and DID postpone a race in 2008 for the very reasons you mentioned. But that is a very serious move, and only to be done as a last resort when entrants are coming from across the country. We did seriously, and in my opinion, responsibly weigh all the factors before greenlighting the race.\r\n\r\nTrail maintenance and repairs are ongoing and occur whether there\u2019s been a race or not. I\u2019ve been removing the course markers section by section, and I think you\u2019ll be pleased to learn, as I have been, that our runners were very conscientious about trash \u2013 there\u2019s been virtually none on the trails. I\u2019m well-acquainted with the trash situation out there, having led several trash clean ups. You may have noticed the difference between now and 2009 on the white trail where it goes by Campground 1. Also the red shoreline trail.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the red shoreline trail, I had to reroute that part of the course onto blue when I learned that part of it, that was fine on Friday afternoon, had risen dramatically overnight. I didn\u2019t get a chance to see it, but reports from runners were enough to make me take action.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long-winded response. I sure appreciate your interest in the well-being of the trails. I\u2019ll be out there again tonight, cleaning blue and white from Marina Road to Lands End, and will give you another report tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\ngary\r\n\r\nFrom: Ben Bolin [mailto:ben@earthriders.com] \r\nSent: Monday, May 24, 2010 10:55 PM\r\nTo: unews@ultrastory.com\r\nSubject: Hawk 50 - post race trail conditions?\r\n\r\nHey Gary,\r\n\r\nSounds like you guys had an interesting race. \r\n\r\nFrom a lot of the reports that I have read it sounds like the trails got trashed too.  What's your take on the damage?  Probably should have moved it to the rain date eh?  I know that mountain bike tour that was scheduled to use some of the trails out there for that day was called off due to wet trail conditions so they wouldn't damage the trail system.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately last year we ran the Bone Bender in similar conditions and trashed the Smithville Lake Trails.  The Smithville Trail Crew spent a lot of volunteer hours fixing post race damage.  We still have a few issues from that event.  That was a big learning lesson for us and we won't be repeating that ever.  Responsible racing to keep the trail systems that we have worked hard to acquire is way more important than making sure the race goes off on the date.  Building a race with rain dates/proper trail condition dates is very important to doing that.  \r\n\r\nJust curious if you guys have plans for post race trail repairs?   I think there are some upset trail users outside of the trail running community.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get your take on the situation.  \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBen Bolin\r\nPresident - EarthRiders Mountain Bike Club\r\n", "status": 2, "allow_comments": true, "repost_date": null, "author": 3, "tease": "", "modified": "2010-05-25 10:17:18", "publish": "2010-05-25 10:16:10", "created": "2010-05-25 10:17:18", "title": "Post-race trail conditions", "repost_url": "", "slug": "post-race-trail-conditions", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "blog.post", "fields": {"body": "Hawk 50-Mile & Marathon Race Director\u2019s Report\r\n\r\nA few hours into the Hawk 50-Mile & Marathon Trail Runs, May 22 on the Clinton Lake North Shore Trails in Lawrence, Kan., our official timer and honorary co-race director Tony \u201cMarine Hawk\u201d Clark says, \u201cGary, everything\u2019s going pretty smoothly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what worries me,\u201d says I.

They look like they\u2019re having a good time, nearly 12 miles into the run.\r\n\r\nOn my way back, I see a beat-up black Camaro has gone off the road, slid down the embankment and is squarely on our course trails.

Tammy says she thinks the guy is drunk.\r\n\r\nI park, go down, and try to help the guy get his car up the embankment, but it\u2019s no use. The rain has made the embankment too slippery and he slides every which way except up and back on to the road\r\n\r\nHe says he was trying to make a u-turn, but went too wide and slid down the embankment.\r\n\r\nA county sheriff arrives, so I figure things are under control and leave.

Tony and I checked the trail Friday night and it was ok, but the lake was still rising as water continued to drain into it. I drive to Campground One, to put \u201cPlan B\u201d into effect \u2013 closing off the shoreline trail, and rerouting the course onto the blue-blazed forest trail that parallels it.\r\n\r\nLevi calls as I start marking the new course.

It\u2019s deeper race day. We had a volunteer down there, Dave Krushek, for most of the day. No one drowned in crossing, but they sure made faces.\r\n\r\nI even did a shift down there watching the brave runners ford the creek. Saw a beaver swim lazily across the surface, and a snake go wriggling by.

Visit his website to see the excellent photos he took of our race, including the Mud Creek crossings.\r\n\r\nWhile all this stuff happened, the race did go on. The runners splished, splashed and slogged through thick mud and standing water. They tore along dry sections of the trail, and puffed and panted up our two hills, Bunker Hill at 11 and 37 miles, and Sanders Mound, at 23 and 49 miles.\r\n\r\nThe woods were gorgeous with golden light slanting through the yellow-green forest canopy.\r\n\r\nBrad \u201cPastor Hawk\u201d Bishop, KCMO, took men\u2019s honors in the 50-mile in a blistering (for our course) 8:53:26, and Laurie \u201cPixie Hawk\u201d Euler, Lawrence, was the women\u2019s champ in 12:47:16.

Alas, Dave wasn\u2019t eligible for marathon honors, since he started in the 50-mile, but opted for the marathon finish.\r\n\r\nHis course was the same as other marathoners, but because the 50-mile race started an hour earlier than the marathon, Dave ran in different, probably slightly cooler conditions.\r\n\r\nBoth Tim and second-place men\u2019s marathoner Pat Perry, Lee\u2019s Summit, said it was the hardest marathon they\u2019d ever run.

I think her husband could be proud of the way she stayed at her post.\r\n\r\nI am.\r\n\r\nWhere the inbound and outbound trails run together, Kristin \u201cAqua Hawk\u201d Tirabassi and Tammy \u201cNightengale Hawk\u201d Lupton made sure that runners took the correct trail entrances \u2013 there were several to choose from.\r\nNo runners were killed by cars sliding down the embankment from the road, for which I credit Tammy and Kristin. There was at least one sliding car that I know of.\r\n\r\nAt the Mud Creek water crossing, Dave Krishock patiently sat and made sure no one drowned. Wish him good luck \u2013 he\u2019s entering the Vermont 100-miler this summer.\r\n\r\nAt race HQ Karen \u201cSassy Hawk\u201d Collier did race day packet pickup and check-in with the help of volunteers Randy and Margy Rose \u2013 my next door neighbors as a matter of fact. Karen\u2019s our treasurer and  also took care of getting the marathon finishing and place awards.\r\n\r\nThey were designed by Justin \u201cGNT Hawk\u201d Henning.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, Justin\u2019s not a volunteer \u2013 he ran the marathon; his first. His longest run before that was eight miles. You watch\u2026once the pain goes away, Justin will be thinking 50k and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarin \u201cLincoln Hawk\u201d Schenidewind was our \u201crover,\u201d keeping all the aid stations resupplied with essentials like bread, ice and cookies.\r\n\r\nOur sweep, Kurt Schueler, ran 21 miles of the course and brought in our last two 50-milers, safe and sound, through some very challenging conditions. I know, because I was along for the ride for the final section from Mud Creek in. Sometimes I thought we were in a mud creek the whole way!\r\n\r\nAfter running, the most important part of a race is food! Our head chefs James \u201cSkull Hawk\u201d Barker and Karen \u201cHawk Who Walks\u201d Henry (my spouse) served up burgers, including veggie; hot dogs; James\u2019 gourmet beans, and other fabulous treats.\r\n\r\nThey were assisted by Rhonda Lyne, Sassy Hawk, Mary Ann \u201cSqueaky Hawk\u201d Frevert, Nicole Knowles, whose spouse John ran the marathon, and Vicki Smith, who did double duty as the race nurse.\r\nShe had a few customers, too.\r\n\r\nDid I leave out anyone? Hmmm\u2026Oh yeah, Co-Race Director Coleen Voeks. She just did\u2026 EVERYTHING! Coleen was everywhere, figuring out staffing, fixing little glitches, checking on everything, on the trails cheering on runners, even typing up and sending out our race results.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s my report. It\u2019s as long as one of my 100-mile race reports, because I was as tired and hungry after as if I\u2019d done Ozark Trail or Leadville.\r\n\r\nNot as stiff, though.\r\n# # #\r\n", "status": 2, "allow_comments": true, "repost_date": null, "author": 3, "tease": "", "modified": "2010-05-23 21:22:30", "publish": "2010-05-23 19:55:10", "created": "2010-05-23 20:05:25", "title": "Hawk 50-Mile & Marathon Trail Runs", "repost_url": "", "slug": "Hawkrace-report", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "blog.post", "fields": {"body": "Our generous sponsor (and great runner), Garry Gribble, of Garry Gribble\u2019s Running Sports in Lawrence, is not only letting us hold Packet Pickup for the Hawk at the Lawrence store, 2-7 pm Friday May 22, he is also offering a 20 percent discount to all Hawk entrants \u2013 once they have their bibs.

The marathon course measures 26.8 miles, and the 50-Mile, is right at 50 miles.\r\n\r\nWe'll mark the course with hot pink (a color not found in nature) flags and ribbons, and supplement those with signs and volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe trails are already fairly well-marked with paint blazes in red, white and blue, and for the most part, the course will follow them. All runners will complete the 26.8-mile marathon course, then 50-milers will continue for a second, but shorter 23.2-mile lap.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works. The races begin (and finish) by Shelter 2. there's a brief run across the lawn to the trail head, by the start/finish aid station.\r\n\r\nRunners head west on the white-blazed trail about 6 miles to the Lands End aid station. Continue on the white trail about 5 more miles to the West Park Road Aid Station.\r\n\r\nThere, you'll leave the trails for a 1.1-mile out & back to nearby Bunker Hill, so named because there's an actual bunker, which you'll see, built into it.\r\n\r\nOn the hill, you'll run the ridge, with pretty park views on either side, and round the wooden park bench to head back to the West Park Road aid station.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: There will be a secret \"code phrase\" on the park bench that you must read and commit to memory. Don't worry, it'll be easy. When you return to the West Park Road aid station, you must speak the phrase to the volunteer checking people in and out. This will help the aid station to differentiate between incoming and outgoing runners, which can be pretty confusing.\r\n\r\nFrom the West Park Road aid station, you'll cross West Park Road and continue on the white-blazed trail to its terminus on Cactus Ridge. There are some actual cacti. Where the white blazes end, the blue blazes begin, and you'll follow them East for about 2 more miles to the Swim Beach aid station on the sandy shores of Clinton Lake.\r\n\r\nThis is one of several places you can jump in the water for a cooling dip if you're so inclined.\r\n\r\nFrom Swim Beach, continue on the blue-blazed trail to its intersection with the red-blazed shoreline trail. This trail goes about a mile along a highly technical (rocks) section of lake front. At the red-blazed trail's end, you'll rejoin the blue-blazed trail for a short uphill into the Lands End Aid Station. From there, continuing on the blue-blazed trail, you go about 3.3 miles, then suddenly drop south for another 1.1-mile out and back, this time to Sanders Mound, another hill overlooking the lake.\r\n\r\nReturning to the blue-blazed trail, it's a short scramble to the start/finish aid station, where the blue-blazed trail meets the white-blazed trail.\r\n\r\nBut wait, you're not done with the marathon course. The start/finish aid station is 23.2 miles into the race. So continue West 2.1 miles on the white-blazed trail to Marina Road. There, you cross over to the blue trail, just a few feet away. We plan to have a volunteer on station there to make sure you don't miss. Then, head back east on blue to the start/finish aid station, 26.8 miles.\r\n\r\nMarathoners reach the start/finish aid station, then run up the lawn to the finish line at Shelter 2, where the race started. There, Co-RD Coleen \"Lil Big Hawk\" Voeks and/or myself will make a big fuss, give your finisher's award and demand that you eat something right away. The cookout should be going strong by then.\r\n\r\n50-milers will NOT go up on the lawn to the finish -- instead, they will continue on the white-blazed trail for another full 23.2 mile lap, complete with Bunker Hill, Cactus Ridge, the Red Trail and Sanders Mound.\r\n\r\nTHEN you get to do the finisher's lawn-run to the adoring crowd and finisher's award and cookout waiting for you.\r\n\r\nAs course-designer Nick \"Colo Hawk\" Lang puts it -- Marathoners will do a big loop and a little loop. 50-milers will do a big loop, a little loop, and another big loop.\r\n\r\nMap coming shortly!", "status": 2, "allow_comments": true, "repost_date": null, "author": 3, "tease": "", "modified": "2010-05-02 20:52:38", "publish": "2010-05-02 20:51:03", "created": "2010-05-02 20:52:05", "title": "Hawk 50 and Hawk Marathon Courses Finalized", "repost_url": null, "slug": "hawk-50", "tags": "hawk50"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "blog.post", "fields": {"body": "So as Freestate showed us, the mud at Clinton can get pretty nasty. I don't want the mud to be a reason to for people to avoid running the Hawk 50 and marathon. So inorder to help divert this \"mud sucks\" mentality, I'd like to share some of my tips I've learned for running in the mud at Clinton. Below is an entry from my \"blog\":http://skooshmagoo.com/2010/04/10/mud-sucks-right/ reposted here to the Trailhawk blog.\r\n\r\nMany people I run with on a regular basis complain about how mud sucks. It\u2019s sloppy, it pulls your shoes off, makes you dirty and all around just makes for a bad run. I think it\u2019s fairly safe to say that some of the mud we get around here in Lawrence (and Kansas in general) is pretty nasty at best. The mud out at Wyco is some of the best around. The trails at Clinton lake just never seem to dry out\u2026ever! In the winter time you\u2019ll be running on frozen mud, which is a trick in and of itself.\r\n\r\nWell I\u2019m here to show you how running in the mud can actually be fun and maybe even enjoyable! I have a tendency to use mud as my great equalizer in trail races. While I\u2019m not really the fastest guy around, I don\u2019t let mud slow me down (too much) and even in some instances I find myself speeding up. What\u2019s my secret? It\u2019s understanding how mud makes it\u2019s suction on your shoe. I\u2019m gonna try and break this down in to as small of steps as possible and then put em together in hopefully a way that easy to remember, and eventually will become second nature.\r\n\r\nFirst thing, you need to drop your center of gravity. That means you need to squat. You don\u2019t have to get low, but you need to drop a bit. When you drop your center of gravity your reactions speed up. You\u2019re no longer straight up like a tree. You\u2019re legs are charge and have a little energy so that if you slip you\u2019re more prepared to respond.\r\n\r\nNext you want to squeeze your butt together. What this does is activates your core. You could also squeeze your stomach, but I find that it\u2019s a little easier to grasp if you squeeze your cheeks! Having your core charged helps with your balance. This will also aid in keeping up right if you slip, or hit a hiding rock or root.\r\n\r\nYou will want to run with short steps. I know a lot of road runners like to extend their stride and really reach, covering a lot of ground with each step. But that\u2019s not now you should run on the trail. And in mud you want to run with even shorter steps.\r\n\r\nHIGH KNEES! Keep those knees up. This is crucial to aiding in proper form through the mud. If you keep your knees up it\u2019ll help with the next step.\r\n\r\nStay on your toes. No heel strikes. The way mud works, is as soon as it\u2019s able to form a seal around the sole of your shoe it\u2019ll want to keep it! If you keep your toes down. Imagine you\u2019re stabbing the mud with your foot. This will go along way with keeping the mud from forming a seal around the sole of your shoe. It will also help keep your shoes on!\r\n\r\nNow pulling it all together, Squat, squeeze your butt, stab the mud with your forefoot! Or even shorter, Squat Squeeze Stab!\r\n\r\nOne other trick that really helps when the mud reaches knee high is to use what\u2019s known as the Loop Lock Low (or as I like to call it the Power loop!)in your lacing strategy. Inov-8 has some other lacing strategies feel free to try em out yourself. I find that Loop Lock Low works best for me. And lucky for me it\u2019s also the default lacing system that comes on all Inov-8 shoes.", "status": 1, "allow_comments": true, "repost_date": "2010-04-10", "author": 1, "tease": "", "modified": "2010-06-16 09:35:27", "publish": "2010-04-30 09:36:25", "created": "2010-04-30 09:39:25", "title": "Mud Sucks, Right?", "repost_url": "http://skooshmagoo.com/weblog/2010/apr/10/mud-sucks-right/", "slug": "mud-sucks-right", "tags": ""}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "blog.post", "fields": {"body": "Sunday morning I couldn't resist heading out for a run in the sun.  If you're from around the area, you know we haven't had much of it lately.  Not only was I excited about the sun, I was still riding an accomplishment high from the day before.  I ran 10 miles for the first time in a month.  It was solo, except for the voices in my head (Metric and Muse).  It was a great run and I needed more so I decided to find out if I had any juice left.  As I was getting ready to leave, I happened to glance under the couch to see my brand new New Balance WT100's (I said new new and you'll deal with it!).  I slipped on the ultra lightweight virgin shoes and pranced out the door.  (Yes, these shoes are so lightweight they force you to prance wherever you go.)\r\n\r\nWithin the first half mile I rolled my ankle running on a sloped portion of the trail.  No big deal!  I realized that the mesh being as thin and stretchy as it is, called for tightening the laces to prevent my foot from being able to rotate within the shoe.  Speaking of the thinness of the upper...it's real thin.  It's just a skimpy piece of mesh attached to the sole.  It's many times thinner than the upper of the 790, for example.\r\n\r\nWhen I went through my first water crossing, I received quite a shock.  My feet said, \"OMG, do you know this water is 30 freakin' degrees?!  Why do you hate us?\"  So, like I said, the upper is extremely thin.  You're basically running around with a soled sock on your foot.  I'll be the first one to tell you, I love brisk water crossings, but I was outbrisked on Sunday.  Moral of the story: I wouldn't wear these in sub freezing temps through water.  \r\n\r\nBetween miles 1 and 2, I tested out the toe protection.  There isn't any.  I wedged my toes between a couple rocks and it hurt like a bad word!  I smacked myself around a little and told me to pay closer attention to where I was putting my feet.  Ok, so there is a thin layer of a toughish material stitched to the toe area of the shoe.  I imagine it's there simply to prevent objects from slicing through the shoe, but if you think it's going to prevent you from breaking the sh*t out of your toes, you're mistaken.  I didn't kick any more rocks for the rest of the run, so I give it two thumbs up for idiot proofing.\r\n\r\nBetween miles 2 and 6 point something, it was smooth sailing...and running even.  These shoes are so light and conform so well, it's hard to slow down in them.  On my way out to Land's End I just kept running faster and faster.  I felt like a beast!  I was having too much fun to be conservative.  As a result, the last 3.5mi were rather unbeastly.  My legs were pooped from rocking those hills.\r\n \r\n+Other Stuff+\r\nI don't think I tested the rock plate much as I was avoiding stepping on sharp rocks.  I can tell you that the soles of my feet weren't tender after the run though.  Also, once I tied this shoe properly it fit like a glove, so I didn't get any hot spots from friction between my foot and the shoe.\r\n\r\n+Take-away Tips+\r\n* Don't be afraid to snug those laces.\r\n* Watch your toes, because your shoes don't care if you break them.\r\n* Beware of freezing temps + water. \r\n* Enjoy your foot gloves!\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: These are my personal opinions and thoughts on the product.
